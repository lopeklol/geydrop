    <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
    
    <h2>&sect;1. General Provisions</h2>
    <p>1.1. These Terms of Service define the rules for using the website and all rights and obligations of Users.</p>
    <p>1.2. Using the website constitutes acceptance of all provisions of these Terms without reservation.</p>
    <p>1.3. The website is not responsible for actions taken by Users, regardless of their consequences.</p>
    <p>1.4. The Terms may be changed at any time, and continued use of the website implies acceptance of all changes.</p>
    <p>1.5. The User agrees to abide by the rules set forth in these Terms and refrain from actions that may disrupt the website's functionality.</p>

    <h2>&sect;2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>2.1. By registering or using the website, the User agrees to all Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <p>2.2. By clicking "I accept terms of service" the User agrees to transfer their soul, dreams, and any illusions about getting rich quickly.</p>
    <p>2.3. Accepting the Terms also means agreeing to unconditionally accept the results of random draws.</p>
    <p>2.4. If the User does not accept the Terms, they are required to leave the website immediately - though we know they won't.</p>
    <p>2.5. The website reserves the right not to inform Users about changes to the Terms.</p>

    <h2>&sect;3. Cases, Keys, and Rewards</h2>
    <p>3.1. The User acknowledges that the results of draws are completely random.</p>
    <p>3.2. "Random" means that the algorithm works in a way that benefits the website but not necessarily the User.</p>
    <p>3.3. Opening a case does not guarantee receiving an item worth more than the cost of opening the case.</p>
    <p>3.4. The website is not responsible for any emotional distress caused by disappointing rewards.</p>
    <p>3.5. Any complaints regarding draw results will be processed immediately - with an automatic rejection.</p>

    <h2>&sect;4. Personal Data</h2>
    <p>4.1. The website may collect User personal data solely for marketing purposes and potential sale to third parties.</p>
    <p>4.2. The User agrees to provide only truthful personal data under the threat of bad luck in draws.</p>
    <p>4.3. The website commits to storing User data securely (meaning in a .txt file on the desktop).</p>
    <p>4.4. In case of a data breach, the website bears no responsibility, and the User acknowledges this.</p>
    <p>4.5. User data may be used for experimental purposes, though probably not.</p>

    <h2>&sect;5. Support</h2>
    <p>5.1. All support requests are welcome but not necessarily processed.</p>
    <p>5.2. The average response time from support is 3 to 5 business years.</p>
    <p>5.3. The website does not guarantee effective problem resolution.</p>
    <p>5.4. Contacting support is only possible via carrier pigeon or telepathic communication.</p>
    <p>5.5. Responses to inquiries may be randomly generated and not necessarily related to the User's problem.</p>

    <h2>&sect;6. Right to Modify</h2>
    <p>6.1. The website reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time without notifying the User.</p>
    <p>6.2. If changes are made, the User automatically accepts them - even if unaware of them.</p>
    <p>6.3. These Terms apply retroactively, meaning the User agrees to previous versions, even if they did not exist at the time.</p>
    <p>6.4. Any attempts to challenge these Terms will be ignored or treated as a joke.</p>
    <p>6.5. If the Terms are modified in favor of the User, such changes will not take effect.</p>

    <p><b>Thank you for accepting the Terms! By clicking "I accept terms of service" you confirm that you have read everything above. And we know you didn't.</b></p>
